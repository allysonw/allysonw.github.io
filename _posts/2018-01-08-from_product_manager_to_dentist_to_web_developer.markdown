Welcome to my Learn.co blog! This is my first post, and in it I'll give you an idea of why I decided to learn web development.

### **My Background**
I’ve had an interest in computer science since my first programming class freshman year of high school, where we learned to use BASIC to create simple programs. I remember being utterly confused by the concept of a “function,” a topic that our teacher introduced with care and patiently took a week to explain to us. I soon realized how fascinating computer programming could be, and dove in to any courses my high school and local community college offered.

Though I had considered majoring in CS in college, when I arrived on campus I was immediately intimidated by the difficulty of the classes and the terrifically smart students who were taking them. I was unsure whether I could succeed as a CS major, and so my 18-year-old self decided that the best course of action was to switch tracks to Linguistics, a topic that still gave me access to concepts related to CS, such as grammars, syntax, and functions. As time passed, I realized I wanted to get more exposure to CS and ended up taking several classes in the subject, enjoying the feeling of solving problems and building stuff.

### **Product Manager**
During the summer of my junior year I interned at Google as a product manger. I figured this role would allow me to be around software without actually creating it myself. After graduation I worked full-time for several years as a product manager, but I ultimately started to feel that the role wasn't right for me. Though I loved the parts of my job that included data mining and analysis, coding, and other technical tasks, I found I disliked the broader set of responsibilities that came with product management. I mistakenly took this to mean that maybe the tech world wasn't for me after all, and I decided to switch careers to dentistry. This may seem strange (it did to pretty much everyone I told!) but I thought it was a good fit, due in part to my love of science, and in part to the opportunity to make a visible difference in people’s lives.

### *Dental School**
Fast forward four years and I am almost at the end of my dental studies. I’ll have my degree in hand in June, yet I am not taking the licensing exams required to practice. Throughout the course of dental school, I found that my interest in dentistry, though founded in hundreds of hours of shadowing dentists, discussions with dentists, and careful consideration, was fading. By the beginning of my final year I realized I simply did not like clinical dentistry- the day-to-day work of taking care of patients. At this point, I paused to ask myself, “What would I actually love doing with my days?” When one of my old co-workers suggested I become a software engineer, my first though was: *I can't go to any more school!* She suggested looking around for online training programs, and when I discovered Flatiron School, I found the answer to my question. I would love to spend my days coding! I think I’ve always wanted to be a software engineer, but I've been hesitant to take that first step. Going through Flatiron's Bootcamp Prep course reminded me how much I missed coding, and how thrilling it was. I stayed up late over the holidays completing the course and by the New Year I realized that I had found my next step. I enrolled in the Online Web Developer program this week and I'm excited to see where it takes me!
